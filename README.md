# california-house-pricing

I use Python to predict housing prices in California. Specifically, I perform regressions with the Random Forest algorithm, and I focus on Scikit Learn's pipelines, K-fold cross validation, and fine-tuning of hyperparameters through grid search.

Output is displayed in the file **California Housing Price Pricing.ipynb**.
